## 📝 Overview
This project demonstrates a comprehensive machine learning workflow for classifying iris species using the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm. The notebook covers:
- End-to-end data science best practices (EDA, preprocessing, modeling, evaluation, and interpretation)
- Hyperparameter tuning and model analysis
- Professional documentation and reproducibility standards

**Goal:** Classify iris flowers into one of three species based on four physical features. This project is ideal for those seeking a clear, portfolio-ready example of classification analysis in classic datasets.

## 🚀 Features
### Data Preparation
- **Dataset Loading:** Uses the scikit-learn Iris dataset (4 features, 3 classes)
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Statistical summaries, class distribution, and visualizations (pairplots, countplots)
- **Preprocessing:**
  - Feature scaling (StandardScaler)
  - Train/test split (80%/20%, stratified)

### Modeling
- **K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier:**
  - Scikit-learn implementation
  - Hyperparameter tuning (k, distance metric, weights) via GridSearchCV
- **Pipeline:** Combines scaling and modeling for reproducibility

### Evaluation & Interpretation
- **Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix
- **Cross-Validation:** 5-fold cross-validation for model stability
- **Baseline Comparison:** Majority class baseline
- **Visualization:**
  - Decision boundary plots (2D slice)
  - Accuracy vs. k-value plots

## ⚡ Quickstart
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EvanGks/knn-iris-classification.git
   cd knn-iris-classification
   ```
2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   - **Windows:**
     ```bash
     python -m venv .venv
     .venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - **macOS/Linux:**
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv .venv
     source .venv/bin/activate
     ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook KNN.ipynb
   ```
5. **Run all cells** to reproduce the analysis and results.

**Troubleshooting:**
- If you encounter missing package errors, ensure your Python environment is activated and up to date.

## 💻 Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`KNN.ipynb`) using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
2. Execute the notebook cells sequentially to follow the entire workflow.
3. Review the outputs and visualizations for insights into the performance and behavior of the KNN classifier.
4. Adapt and extend the analysis as necessary for further experimentation or integration into broader projects.

## 📊 Results
### Model Metrics
- **Test Accuracy:** Typically > 0.95 (varies by random split)
- **Precision, Recall, F1-score:** High for all classes (see classification report in notebook)
- **Confusion Matrix:** Visualizes correct and incorrect predictions
- **Best Hyperparameters:** Determined via GridSearchCV

### Visualizations
- **Pairplots:** Feature relationships and class separability
- **Decision Boundary Plot:** Class separation in 2D feature space
- **Accuracy vs. k Plot:** Shows effect of neighbor count on performance

---

## 📝 Limitations and Future Work
- **Sensitivity to Feature Scaling:** KNN performance depends on proper scaling
- **Computational Cost:** Not ideal for very large datasets
- **Potential Improvements:**
  - Apply dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA)
  - Test on larger or more complex datasets
  - Compare with other classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees)
  - Explore advanced hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation
